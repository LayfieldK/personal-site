  <div class="panel-body">
  <p>AlertBot is a service used by hundreds of the world's top retailers to monitor website performance.  The service alerts users when their sites have problems which require attention, and reports many useful statistics to them in a multitude of ways.  Dozens of reports can be accessed through the service's Manager site, or they can be emailed to account users weekly.  The AlertBot brand has earned the trust of many noteworthy customers including Sony, IBM, Dell, Disney, and the United States Marines.</p>
  <p>Since 2009, I have been the lead developer on all software, database solutions, and websites for AlertBot.</p><p>Some of the projects I've worked on include, but are not limited to:</p>  
  <ul>
    <li>a Manager website which allows users to maintain all aspects of their accounts</li>
    <li>the testing agent from which we monitor all of our clients' sites</li>
    <li>a Selenium based "recorder" which allows our customers to record scripts that simulate what a typical user of their site would do on a visit to their page</li>
    <li>a testing module that reproduces these scripts within a real web browser</li>
    <li>a custom load balancer for our complex testing network which spans the globe</li>
    <li>dozens of analytical reports that inform our clients on the performance of their websites</li>
    <li>our databases which contain hundreds of tables, views, and procedures</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The AlertBot brand has been the primary concern of my professional career since graduating from college, and I am immensely proud of the product.</p>

    <h2>Eve Watch</h2>
  </div>
  
  <div class="panel-body">
  <p>Eve Watch is an app on the Google Play store designed for players of the popular multiplayer game, Eve Online.  Eve Online is a game set in space, where players are pilots of ships that can fill roles such as miners, pirates, traders, or soldiers.  The game is set in a persistent universe, so the game is always running, even if you're not logged in.  Taking a note from my work on AlertBot, I decided to create an app for Eve Online players that would send them notifications when certain events occurred in-game.  Since Eve Online is a persistent universe, many important things can happen while the player is not logged in to the game.  For example, a user's personal space station could come under attack by a rival group of players.  In this case, a player could lose his (very) expensive property without ever having a chance to defend it.  Eve Watch can be configured to send an alert directly to the player's Android device when such an event occurs, giving them a chance to defend their territory.  In fact, the app can send different notifications for over 140 in-game events.</p>
  <p>The app was written in Java, and was created for two reasons.  First, I wanted to get some exposure to mobile app development and using APIs.  Second, I was a huge fan of Eve Online at the time of the app's creation, and I wanted to contribute to the community.</p>

    <h2>A* Research</h2>
  </div>
  
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>Artificial intelligence, particularly in the context of video games, has always been an interest of mine.  I've often felt that for all of the excitement built up over upgrades in the graphics of games, not enough uproar is created at the lack of improvement in the AI in the majority of modern games.  One particular field of AI that I find particularly interesting is that of pathfinding.</p>
    <p>A* (pronounced A Star) is a pathfinding algorithm that is used in a variety of contexts beyond video games.  However, most of my research has been exclusive to the video game side of the algorithm.  Characters, or units, in most games use a pathfinding algorithm to move from point A to point B in a level.  If only one unit were to move at a time, there would be no problems with A* and units should be able to flawlessly make the shortest moves possible to reach their destinations.  A problem arises when multiple units move simultaneously.  If two units are ordered to move directly toward each other to a destination on the other side of the opposing unit, they will inevitably walk straight into each other and then look unintelligent while they attempt to navigate around each other.  I spent time researching a modified version of A* called Hierarchical Cooperative A* which aims to eliminate this problem by taking other units movement over time into consideration when plotting movement routes.</p>
    <p>To assist myself in visualizing the problem with A*, I created an applet in Java full of "nodes" where a unit can occupy space.  Within the applet, users can create custom pathfinding scenarios, or choose from any of 3 troublesome types of pathfinding situations.  These randomly generated, yet predefined, scenarios include a bottleneck, a random grid full of units and walls, and a setup where every unit on the map must reach their destination directly across the map from their starting points.  Also included in the applet is the ability to run massive amounts of tests with no visual element for data analysis.</p>

  Among the Helvetii, Orgetorix was by far the most distinguished and wealthy.

To this he the more easily persuaded them, because the Helvetii, are confined on every side by the nature of their situation; on one side by the Rhine, a very broad and deep river, which separates the Helvetian territory from the Germans; on a second side by the Jura, a very high mountain, which is [situated] between the Sequani and the Helvetii; on a third by the Lake of Geneva, and by the river Rhone, which separates our Province from the Helvetii.
